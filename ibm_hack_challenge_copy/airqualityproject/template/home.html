        <h1>Real time Air Quality Monitoring and Weather Forecasting</h1>
        <p>As for consumables, the most proportionate intake of humans is considered to be air. As of recent outbreaks, the air around the living systems is being polluted in different possible lookouts. By predicting the gas percentage in the air, it is possible to variate the number of toxic gases present in the air.</p>
        <p>On the account of previously present dataâ€™s on-air quality, the fluctuations and concentration of other gases could be predicted using Machine learning. While considering weather forecasting, capturing the periodic patterns in previous data will yield results with future occurrences and necessary precautions. A user Interface and   a dashboard will be provided as an implementation along with analytics as an outcome confronting the problem.</p>

            Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.

            The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. AQI information is obtained by averaging readings from an air quality sensor, which can increase due to vehicle traffic, forest fires, or anything that can increase air pollution. Pollutants tested include ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, among others.
